# Some Key Notes

### TODO

Figure out how to not show "GMMSC ICT Club" on every blog post. Instead just show specific author who wrote it. I know it should be possible based on a demo I saw on Blowfish docs.

### Configuration Parameters
Configuration files are in `config/_default`

### Adding authors
A new JSON file needs to be added for each author inside /data/authors

### Images
All images need to go under `assets/img`  (not `static`)
